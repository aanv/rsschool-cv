## About Me 

I am interested in learning programming to improve competence in my current position, as well as to get a developer position in future.

At school, I always got the highest marks in mathematics and physics. But then I decided to take up creativity and entered the Academy of Arts, against what I'd been told by teachers and parents. I graduated as a Cinematographer. Then over the course of 8 years I managed to work as a videographer, photography teacher, video editor. I filmed weddings, concerts, organized photo sessions, studio shooting, post-processing, photo retouching, atmospheric sound recording... until fate let me get a job in a big international IT startup. 

While I was climbing the corporate ladder there, I gradually became involved in teamleading, requirements development, project management, analytics. To speed up the work, I had to learn the basics of scripting. From that moment I fell in love with the magic when your code fills the cells of the tables, changes properties and displays something on the screen.

## Skills 
- SQL (Amazon Athena, Mode Analytics)
- Git
- Google Apps Script (Basic)
- HTML (Basic)
- JS (Basic)


## Code Example

The below function returns the middle characters of given word:

```
function getMiddle(s)
{
  return s.substr(Math.trunc(s.length / 2 - 1), s.length % 2 === 0 ? 2 : 1);
}
```
